# K-Nearest-Neighbors-From-Scratch

## Objective
The goal of this project is to understand how K-nearest neigbhors works.<br>
The experiment is implemented using PyTorch.

## Wine Quality Dataset
The K-nearest neighbors is trained on physicochemical data to predict the quality of a red or white wine<br>
This dataset contains 6497 samples and the following features:
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality

## Setup
In order to install the conda environment needed to run the notebook, run the following line:
```console
conda env create --file requirements.yml
conda activate torch
```

## Notebook
The experiment can be found in the notebook at the root of the project.
